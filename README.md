# PetCentre

## Overview

PetCentre is a combined web-based system designed for improving the health and welfare of animals by making veterinary services readily available. Pet owners, rescuers, adopters, pharmacies, and animal welfare organizations commonly communicate over telephone, social media, and informal means. This often makes veterinary services less accessible, timely, and uncoordinated, among many other issues.

PetCentre solves this problem by providing a complete online platform that enables users to:
